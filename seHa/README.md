# Prevention of Sexual Harassment

### What kinds of behaviour cause sexual harassment?

Sexual harassment involves behaviors that make the workplace uncomfortable or hostile. These include:

1. **Unwanted physical contact**: Any form of inappropriate touching or physical contact.
2. **Sexually suggestive language**: Comments, jokes, or gestures that are sexually explicit or degrading.
3. **Quid pro quo**: When sexual favors are demanded in exchange for job benefits, promotions, or avoiding negative consequences.
4. **Hostile work environment**: Repeated inappropriate behavior such as sexual advances, lewd comments, or suggestive looks.

### What would you do in case you face or witness any incident or repeated incidents of such behaviour?

If you experience or witness sexual harassment, here are the steps you can take:

- **Document the incidents**: Keep a record of details like the time, place, and nature of the behavior.
- **Report the harassment**: Inform HR or use the company's official reporting channels. External bodies may be contacted if necessary.
- **Support the victim**: If you are a bystander, intervene when safe, or help the victim in reporting the incident.
