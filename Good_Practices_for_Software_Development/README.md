# Good Practices for Software Development

## Question 1:

### Which point(s) were new to you?
One point that stood out as new was the emphasis on using tools like GitHub gists and sandbox environments (like Codepen or Codesandbox) for sharing code snippets and setups. While I'm familiar with sharing code, the suggestion to utilize these specific tools for better communication and clarity when asking for help was insightful. Additionally, the idea of sending a single message with multiple questions instead of bombarding team members with several messages was a fresh approach that I hadn't considered.

## Question 2:

### Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?
I think I need to improve my communication, particularly in being more mindful of my teammates’ availability and workloads. To make progress in this area, I plan to:

1. **Schedule Regular Check-Ins**: I will try to find out my teammates’ work schedules and set up regular check-ins when they are available. This way, I can ensure our conversations are timely and productive.

2. **Consolidate Messages**: Instead of sending multiple messages throughout the day, I will compile my questions and updates into a single message to respect their time and reduce clutter in our communication channels.

3. **Be Available for Real-Time Conversations**: I’ll make it a point to be more responsive when someone replies to my messages, facilitating quicker resolutions and smoother communication.
